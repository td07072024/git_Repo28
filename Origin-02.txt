The structure of the Maratha state was that of a confederacy of four Rajas under the leadership of the Peshwa at Poona (now Pune) in western India from 1721 till 1818. These were the Raja of Baroda of the House of Gaekwad, the Raja of Indore of the House of Holkar, Raja of Ujjain of the House of Scindia, and the Raja of Nagpur of the House of Bhonsle, while the Peshwa's dominions included the territories that later became the Bombay Province[c] and Central Provinces.

After he was defeated by the Holkar dynasty in 1802, the Peshwa Baji Rao II sought protection from the British East India Company, whose intervention destroyed the confederacy by 1818 after the Second and Third Anglo-Maratha Wars. The stable borders of the confederacy after 1737 extended from modern-day Maharashtra[32] in the south to Gwalior in the north after the Battle of Bhopal (1737), to Orissa in the east[33] or about a third of the subcontinent.
